We will be doing a lot of interactions with OS, and python has mature extensive libraries to do that.
There are tons of Python libraries and modules, like click, argparse, docopt, etc., to help build a command line interface 
resuting in things like colourized output, progress bars for telling the runtime status, etc.
Using these we can also handle the error cases better, letting the user know where they exactly went wrong.
We can automatically generate help messages and let the user know more on command's usage and its syntax, and the various options available with those commands.
With these modules in Python, we can create an interactive command line interface in a clean and efficient way.
Also, our aim is to add a command line helper bot in the future, which will need deep learning/NLP constraints, and python has most mature libraries supporting those.
