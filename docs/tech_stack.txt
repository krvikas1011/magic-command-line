Our goal is to create an OS-independent command line tool.  
There are tons of Python libraries and modules, like click, argparse, docopt, etc., to help build a command line app from parsing arguments and 
options to flagging to full blown CLI “frameworks” which do things like colorized output, progress bars, sending email and so on.
We can automatically generate help messages and get a strong control over our help page.
With these modules in Python, we can create a beautiful and interactive command line interface in a clean and efficient way.
Also, our aim is to add a command line helper bot in the future, which will need deep learning/NLP constraints, and python has most mature libraries supporting those.
